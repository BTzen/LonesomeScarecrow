Bugs: <br />
- rapidly left-clicking during a move causes the CPU to make multiple moves

Some things to be aware of: <br />
1) type="number" used for ply in html file is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions<br />
2) 'initial' keyword used in CSS not supported in IE<br />
3) jquery ui and chrome come together to make a weird effect for the dialog box (x has focus and is bigger than button) - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23001424/how-do-i-get-rid-of-this-blue-halo-around-the-close-dialog-button-with-jqueryui
